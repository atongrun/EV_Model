This model is a single-motor electric vehicle model ðŸš—, which can be simulated and run normally. However, please note that there may be significant issues within the model. When studying, it is important to approach it critically. The missing table data mentioned is not publicly available as it belongs to the research group and is considered their proprietary resource.

## New Content Added

â€‹	Due to the initial version (EV_v0.1) of the uploaded model lacking some internal research group data, and in response to student requests, a new version (EM_v0.2) has been added. The model can be downloaded and run smoothly. For the motor, a 34 kW rated power motor was selected from a random Master's thesis, with a maximum torque of 130 Nm. The motor characteristics were created based on approximate data, with a fixed efficiency of 0.95. As for the battery section, fixed internal resistance and fixed individual cell voltage values were provided directly.

<font color=Red>Notes</font>:underage:

+ The model roughly captures the characteristics of an electric vehicle, but the data is not reliable.
+ Intended for simple learning and reference purposes, or as a foundation.
